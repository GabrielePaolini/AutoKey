R"=====(DESCRIPTION:
AUTO-KEY is a little program written in C++ that allows the user to give 
a sequence of alphanumericals and/or control sequences via virtual keyboard. 
Every character will be typed automatically by the program, 
followed by the next one in the sequence after a specific period of time 
(expressed in milliseconds), defined by the user.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The user will first be asked to enter the character to be simulated. 
By pressing ENTER, the user will then be prompted to insert an integer 
number that defines the delay, in milliseconds, between the keying of 
a character and the next one. 
To terminate this procedure, press ESC on the keyboard. 
After that, the program will give 3 seconds to select the program/window 
on which we want to simulate typing. 
Type "cls" at any moment in the menu to clear the screen. 

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR THE CURRRENT VERSION:
To terminate the program, it's necessary to close the terminal on which
AUTO-KEY was started (by pressing CTRL+C with the terminal window focused, for example).
The program was written using standard Windows libraries.
