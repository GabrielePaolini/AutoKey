# AutoKey
This is a small program that could be useful to test or experiment with other software where the user can interact via keyboard.
The idea behind this program is utilised everyday to test, or example, smartphone apps and check if there is a chance to crash them if a certain sequence of inputs is entered. 
These are obviously very sophisticated softwares, but if you wish to setup a quick test in a matter of minutes, you can use this program.

This repo comes with an executable compiled with g++ under Windows 10 (see menu.txt).
The source code is available and the program itself can be built in just a few seconds along with its icon).

The instructions are all clearly described within the program, so give it a try and don't use it with potentially harmful programs!
